```

Before creating assignments, you will need to create the associated units and subjects using the `hoot unit` and `hoot subject` commands, respectively.

### Subjects

Hoot runs on this folder directory:

`School / Term <number> / <Subject> / <Unit> / <Assignments|Finished|Notes|Homework>`

To generate a subject directory with `hoot.json`, run:

`hoot new subject <title>`

Where `<title>` is the name of the subject.

Use the `hoot new <item> <name>` command for creation of subjects, units, assignments, or notes!

### Assignments

Assignment generation is done using the `hoot assignment <title>` command, and templating is done by copying an assignment template in the `templates/` folder.
